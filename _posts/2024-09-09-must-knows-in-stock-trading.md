<h2>Account Types</h2>
For everyone who wants to embark on the journey of stock trading, you need to have an account in a brokerage. There are
two types of accounts:
<li><b>Cash account</b>: Leverage is disabled. Investors must pay the full amount of money for what they buy.</li>
<li><b>Margin account</b>: You can borrow money from your brokerage, while depositing a proportion of the amount as the Margin. </li>
Generally, people prefer Margin account, since you can use the lever to throw in more money than you actually have. If you are lucky enough, you get more returns as well.

<h2>Margins</h2>
So via a margin account, you can pay less than the actual value of stock you bought. There the question is, how much you
need to pay? It is the margin. Margin really sucks. So many margin types here!
<li><b>Initial Margin</b>: The amount of money you must pay when you open a position.</li>
<li><b>Maintenance Margin</b>: The minimal amount of equity needed in your account to hold your portfolio. If your account equity doesn't meet the requirement. 
Your broker wll call you to deposit (so-called Margin Call).</li>
