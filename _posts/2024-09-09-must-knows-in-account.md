<h2>Account Types</h2>
For everyone who wants to embark on the journey of stock trading, you need to have an account in a brokerage. There are two types of accounts:
<li><b>Cash account</b>: Leverage is disabled. Investors must pay the full amount of money for what they buy.</li>
<li><b>Margin account</b>: You can borrow money from your brokerage, while depositing a proportion of the amount as the Margin. </li>
Generally, people prefer Margin account, since you can use the lever to throw in more money than you actually have. If you are lucky enough, you get more returns as well.
