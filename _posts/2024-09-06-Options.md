Many programmers like security investment, since they are generally comparatively highly paid. They know some about options, but maybe not so much.
As working in an internet finance company, I'd like to talk something about options from my perspective.

<h2>What is an option?</h2>
Options are a variant of financial derivatives.<br>

Basically, there are two types of options: call options and put options. A Call option gives you rights to buy a security at an appointed price (so-called Strike Price).
Then obviously, a Put option gives you rights to sell a security at the strike price.
