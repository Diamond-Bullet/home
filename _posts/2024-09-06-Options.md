Many programmers like security investment, since they are generally comparatively highly paid. They know some about options, but maybe not so much.
As working in an internet finance company, I'd like to talk something about options from my perspective.

<h2>What is an option?</h2>
Options are a variant of financial derivatives. It's a contract claiming that you can trade a number of a stock at what price.<br>

Basically, there are two types of options: call options and put options. 
<li>A Call option gives you rights to buy a security at an appointed price (so-called Strike Price).</li>
<li>A Put option gives you rights to sell a security at the strike price.</li>

So when you are bullish on one stock, you tend to buy a call option. And when bearish on it, you buy a put option.

<h2>Key concepts on Option</h2>
<li><b>Price</b>: How much you pay to buy an option contract.</li>
<li><b>Strike Price</b>: The price at which you can buy or sell the stock.</li>
<li><b>Underlying</b>: the security you trade. Although stock is the mainstream. you can buy options on futures, indexes, etc.</li>
<li><b>Contract Multiplier</b>: </li>
